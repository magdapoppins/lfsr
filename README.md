# Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register 

### Running Haskell
To run these files, run GHC's interactive mode from the command line by the command `ghci`. The GHCI prompt appears as a sign that everything is ok. You can load a file by typing `:l filename` and reload by `:r`.

### Stream ciphers 
- key at least as long as plaintext (random key stream)
- initialization vector (IV), neither random nor secret, should be used only once for init purposes
- secret key (remains the same)
- initial state 
- seed value

### Pseudorandom bit generators
- if cryptographically secure new bits cannot be predicted with an accuracy over 50% even when all previous bits are known 
- 

### Vocab 

| Word | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Pseudorandom | A process that appears to be random but is being generated by a deterministic causal process |
| Shift register |  |

- using the [data bits package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Data-Bits.html)
